Counting number of unions of neighbourhoods in a bipartite graph is equivalent to counting maximal independent sets in the graph : #MIS. It is the bottleneck in computing heuristics for boolean-width, a graph width parameter inspired by treewidth. #MIS is equivalent to counting maximal clique (just invert graph) and counting independent dominating sets. Searching by more names for the problem gives a larger set of search results.

   - Question: Is counting MIS #P-complete? Even in bipartite graphs? I am guessing yes.
   - Can we reduce #MIS to a #P-complete problem which has an FPTAS? Perhaps DNF?
