# Graphs and Turing machines
 - How to implement BFS/DFS on Turing machine?
 - What happens if each node in a graph contains a stack, queue or even a Turing machine?
 - What happens if the tape of a Turing machine is not a tape but a graph of some kind?
 - What is the relation between control flow graphs, Turing machines and coroutines?
